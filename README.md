## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of the repository, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
|   â””â”€â”€ script.js
|   â””â”€â”€ style.css
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
|       â””â”€â”€ privacy-policy.astro
|       â””â”€â”€ contact.astro
â””â”€â”€ .gitignore
â””â”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â””â”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ package-lock.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

You can create a folder for components: `src/components/`, that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
